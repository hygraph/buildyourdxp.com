Build Your DXP is a community powered catalog to explore the best-of-breed services that power today's Digital Experience Platforms. This project is maintained by [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com)

### What is a DXP?

A DXP, or a Digital Experience Platform, is an emerging category of software aiming to tackle the primary goal of perfecting the customer experience, or CX. Traditionally DXPs have been "full-stack" monoliths that provide an architecture for businesses to digitize their business goals, marketing activities, analytics, and content management. Over time, with the rise of API-driven approaches and the need for omnichannel content distribution, there has been an emergence of micro-services based DXPs, which are essentially a suite of products working in harmony.

[This website](https://buildyourdxp.com) aims to catalog these "best of breed" micro-services that typically come together to form a DXP.

### What is BuildYourDXP.com?

BuildYourDXP is an open-source compilation of tools and services that typically come together to form a DXP. Our goal is to provide an objective landscape of services that follow certain guidelines:

- All tools and services must integrate with one another, either natively, or via a series of configurations.
- They must be independent of the other - whether for deployment, adding in, removing, or modifying - i.e. not a "monolith".
- They must provide an API
- While not necessarily "Headless", each tool must be prominent in their category as an independently scalable component.
- No vendor should be a "monolithic" DXP by itself.
- Each vendor should be a cloud-based SaaS solution for easy adoption, without the obstacles of self-hosting, on-premises, or security upgrades.

To ensure that the information is as up-to-date and comprehensive as possible, this project is completely open-source, and edits/additions are welcomed.
